Ali Salehi	 ASGN2 		README

To use this program, you must first ensure that the math.c file and the Makefile are in the same directory. Next, run the "make" command to compile the code. Following compilation, run the "./math" command followed by an argument. The argument should take the form of a dash "-" followed by "s" for sin, "c" for cos, "t" for tan, "e" for exponential, or "a" for all. Be warned that entering multiple arguments will only result in running the first argument entered. To rerun the program, you must call the "./math" command followed by another argument.

Running infer resulted in no errors.
