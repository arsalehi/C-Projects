Ali Salehi	ASGN3	README

To run this program, ensure that the files stack.h, stack.c, tower.c, and Makefile are all present in the same directory. Next, run the "make" command to compile the files. Now that the program has compiled, run the command "./tower" followed by the "-r" argument to view the recursive solution, the "-s" argument to view the stack solution, and the "-n" argument to change the number of disks. Make sure to include an integer following the "-n" command to avoid being thrown and error. Also note that running only the "-s" or "-r" command is valid, and will default the number of disks to 5. This program can be run multiple times.
